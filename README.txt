...Introduction...

This is a two level 3D-platformer
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
...Usage...

Arrows - walk and turn
X and Arrows - run
Space - jump
C - fly
S - shoot

You can walk, run, jump and fly. Flight is limited by stamina.
Enemies are bees. Bees can be destroyed with multiple shots.
The goals are marked with flags.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
...Additional Items...

I created the player model in MakeHuman and Blender. The model's animations 
come from Unity's standard assets. (I had hoped to add new animations, but did 
not get the chance) The player textures are also created by me.
I modelled and textured the lily-pad surfaces. Other model sources are cited
below. I created the animations for the turtle and bee models.

I included a stamina mechanic that allows for limited flight/floating in addition
to the regular jump mechanic. There are health and stamina bars added to the UI, 
along with a help menu and GameOver/Play Again panels. Scripts in the Scripts 
folder are all written by me with citations for any tutorials used.
